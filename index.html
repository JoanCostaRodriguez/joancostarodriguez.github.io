      <h3>Market Access and Regional Inequality: Evidence from Brazil’s Capital Relocation</h3>
      <p>
        This paper examines the impact of market access on regional inequality, using the relocation of Brazil’s capital to Brasília as a natural experiment. The capital’s relocation was followed by a substantial expansion of infrastructure, particularly highways, which reduced trade costs and enhanced market access throughout all the regions in the country. This study measures the effects of the increased market access across all Brazilian states, with particular attention to differences between rural and industrial regions. Market access and inequality indices are constructed using official data sources. The findings indicate that increases in market
access are associated with an increase in regional inequality in industrial regions, while the effect is significantly attenuated in rural areas.

      <h3>Ideology and Age: A Perspective Across Multiple Generations in Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States</h3>
      <p>
        This study examines political trends across different generations in Spain, comparing them with the United Kingdom and the United States. Using data from the Centre for Sociological Research (CIS), the research explores the ideological evolution of various generations: Post-War Children, Baby Boomers, Generation X, and Millennials.

The study reveals an initial lean towards the left in younger generations, which tends to shift towards more conservative positions as they age. This shift is influenced by a complex interplay of social, political, and economic factors.

The conclusions underscore the impact of historical events, economic circumstances, and social changes on generational political shifts. The study proposes hypotheses that explain the observed trends. The unique characteristics of the Spanish political landscape, which include a wide range of parties and a robust welfare state, contribute to a nuanced interpretation of generational political preferences. Additionally, differences in social policies between right-wing political platforms in the Anglo-Saxon world and the Spanish context are highlighted.
